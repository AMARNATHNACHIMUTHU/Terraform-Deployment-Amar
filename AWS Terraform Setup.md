Setting Up Terraform for AWS


To configure AWS credentials and set up Terraform to work with AWS, follow these steps:

Step 1: Install AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)
Make sure you have the AWS CLI installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the [AWS CLI download page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).


Step 2: Create an AWS IAM User
To interact with AWS programmatically, create an IAM (Identity and Access Management) user with appropriate permissions:

a. Log in to the AWS Management Console
Log in to the AWS Management Console with an account that has administrative privileges.

b. Navigate to the IAM Service
Navigate to the IAM service from the AWS Management Console dashboard.

c. Create a New User
Click on "Users" in the left navigation pane and then click "Add user."

Choose a username for the IAM user.

Select "Programmatic access" as the access type and click "Next: Permissions."

d. Attach Policies
Attach policies to this user based on your requirements. At a minimum, attach the "AmazonEC2FullAccess" policy for basic EC2 operations. If you need access to other AWS services, attach the relevant policies accordingly.

e. Review and Create User
Review the user's configuration to ensure it aligns with your needs.

Create the user. Make sure to save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key that are displayed after user creation; you'll need these for Terraform.



Step 3: Configure AWS CLI Credentials
Use the AWS CLI to configure your credentials. Open a terminal and run the following command:


aws configure



It will prompt you to enter the following information:

AWS Access Key ID
Secret Access Key
Default region
Default output format
Enter the credentials you obtained in the previous step.


By completing these steps, you will have successfully configured Terraform to work with AWS using your IAM user credentials. You can now proceed to create and manage AWS resources using Terraform.
